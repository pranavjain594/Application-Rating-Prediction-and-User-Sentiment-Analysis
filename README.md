# Application-Rating-Prediction-and-User-Sentiment-Analysis
In this work, the ratings of android applications have been
predicted based on different features such as their genre, category, the no. of install
recorded, and so on using various regression techniques. Clustering has been used to
understand the relationship between different attributes. Also, sentiment analysis of users
has been done with the reviews given by them using natural language processing.
